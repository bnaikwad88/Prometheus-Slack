# Prometheus Monitoring and Alerting for Multiple EC2 Instances in Multiple Accounts with Slack Integration

## Objective :
To create a Prometheus monitoring system for multiple Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in multiple accounts and send alerts to a Slack community when any of the servers are down

## Expected Results : 
The result of setting up a Prometheus monitoring system for multiple EC2 instances in multiple accounts and sending alerts to a Slack community when any of the servers are down should be a system that can monitor the status of the EC2 instances and send notifications to the Slack channel if any of the servers are down.

## Some potential benefits of this system may include: 
### Improved uptime :
By monitoring the status of the EC2 instances and being alerted when any of them go down, you can take action to restore service as quickly as possible. 
### Increased visibility:
The Prometheus server and exporters will collect a wide range of metrics about the performance and health of the EC2 instances, which can help you identify trends and issues that may not be immediately apparent. 
### Enhanced collaboration:
By sending alerts to a Slack channel, you can make it easier for team members to stay informed about the status of the EC2 instances and collaborate on resolving any issues that arise. 
<br>**Overall, the result of this system should be a more reliable, transparent, and collaborative way to manage the EC2 instances in your environment.**<br/>
